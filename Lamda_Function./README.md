Lamda Function :

 * The syntax of a lambda function is lambda arguments: expression. 
 * A lambda function can have as many arguments as you need to use, but the body must be one single expression.
 * Note : You can't give a name to lambda functions, as they are anonymous (without a name) by definition.
