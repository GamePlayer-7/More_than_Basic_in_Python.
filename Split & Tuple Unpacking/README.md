Split :

 * When we want to break a bigger string,list into smaller string or list we use Split function.
 *  syntax : split(separator, max)
 *  separator : represents the delimiter based on which the given string or line is separated.
 *  max : represents the number of times a given string or a line can be split up.

Tuple Unpacking :

* In packing, we put values into a new tuple while in unpacking we extract those values into a single variable.
* If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list.

*Note : 

 * Python tuples are immutable means that they can not be modified in whole program.
 * In unpacking of tuple number of variables on left-hand side should be equal to number of values in given tuple.
